Scripts and datasets for network analysis

These scripts were written by Mark R. Groenhuijzen as part of his PhD-thesis 'Palaeogeographic analysis of the Dutch part of the Roman limes and its hinterland: Computational approaches to transport and settlement in the Lower Rhine limes zone in the Netherlands' (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 2018).

The following scripts are available:
- least-cost-path-construction-scripts.rar: Python scripts to be run in ArcGIS to create directed and undirected least cost paths
- betweenness-centrality-robustness-model.rar: NetLogo model to calculate the robustness of betweenness and centrality measures for a site dataset. For its original use case and more information see: Groenhuijzen, M.R., and P. Verhagen. 2016. Testing the Robustness of Local Network Metrics in Research on Archeological Local Transport Networks. Frontiers in Digital Humanities 3. doi: 10.3389/fdigh.2016.00006
- network-construction-scripts.rar: Python scripts to construct networks with non-Euclidean distances, using different network constructing algorithms (maximum distance, proximal points, Gabriel graphs and efficiency networks). For more information see Groenhuijzen, M.R., and P. Verhagen. 2017. Comparing network construction techniques in the context of local transport networks in the Dutch part of the Roman limes.
